# PolygonProject
by Valerio Marcelli

== Introduction == 
The purpose of this project was to create a game inspired by the First Person Games that I grew up with. 
In the process of creating this game, I seek to further my understanding of:
    - Working with game engines
    - Understanding graphics, more specifically the uses for Raycasting
    - Learning game development
    - Problem solving in software development
    - Learn more efficient development habits in software
Except for my knowledge on how to program, everything else had to be self taught, as no courses
on these subjects were available throughout my education. To remedy this, I have used several 
avenues to learn how to use the Unity Engine. Examples include: various Wikis, Forums, Videos, Books.

== Instructions == 
Running the game is simple, although I plan to eventually release a Mac version once the game
is more polished, right now the only way to run the game is through a Windows OS (Preferably Windows 10).

Mouse - Look around
W,A,S,D - Movement (X, Z)
Space - Jump
E - Interact with NPCs/Objects (As of now only the cube under the Signpost is interactable)

V - Equips a weapon (For now this is a staff, set up to showcase basic combat)
X - Attack
